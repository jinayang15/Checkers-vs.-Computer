Old project where you can play checkers against the programmed computer created in Python.
This project was also one of my first experiments with recursion, and I think it turned out well!
Note: At the time, I did not know in regular checkers you can't jump over your own pieces because thats how I always played D: So, in this game both you and the computer can jump over your own pieces.
Instructions are also in the project itself.
